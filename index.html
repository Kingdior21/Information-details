        <td>I became a financial advisor to educate and advocate for families, and to
          help them maintain a healthy level of financial confidence through
          different seasons of life. My passion for this industry came from personal
          experience. In 2009, my partner passed away and I became a single Dad and
          sole provider.</td>

      I was overwhelmed and grieving. When I met with our financial advisor, he
      had empathy and foresight for what lay ahead. We created a plan that
      changed my way of thinking and I started to thrive. He advocated a better
      life for me during a hard season. This experience changed my career to
      financial services so I could also help others through life-changing
      events.

      Over the past 12 years, I have collaborated with firms, consumed
      strategies and concepts, earned professional designations and use an
      established process for families to follow: Organize Assets, Unpack
      Investment Options, and Create Action Plans. When repeated on a
      consistent, long-term basis, it helps families gain clarity and confidence
      in their ability to achieve their financial goals. Wan Houang cares what
      matters most to clients.
